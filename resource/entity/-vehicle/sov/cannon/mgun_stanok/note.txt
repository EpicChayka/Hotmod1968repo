"mgun_stanok" from MOWAS2 mod "Red Rising" is able to move with a single crewman;
May have something to do with fact that in MOWAS2, cannons could "close" (transform into moving state) even with one crew
(though they all still required 2 to actually move anywhere). 
Chassis "humnan_carrier" may hold the keyyyy.
